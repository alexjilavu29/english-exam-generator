# Search Query Integration with Filters

## Overview

Enhanced the question navigation system to preserve search queries when moving between the Questions Database page and Question Details pages, allowing seamless combination of search and filtering functionality.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Search State Preservation
- **Breadcrumb Navigation**: Search queries are now included in the "Filtered Results" breadcrumb
- **Back Navigation**: Users can return to their exact filtered/searched view from question details
- **URL Parameters**: Search terms are preserved in all navigation URLs

### 2. Combined Search + Filter Functionality
- **Simultaneous Use**: Users can now search AND apply filters at the same time
- **State Persistence**: Both search terms and filter selections are maintained across page transitions
- **Consistent Experience**: Whether using search, filters, or both, the navigation behavior is consistent

### 3. Enhanced Breadcrumb System
- **Smart Breadcrumbs**: Shows "Filtered Results" when any combination of search/filters is active
- **Proper URL Generation**: Includes all active parameters (search, topic, category, year, tag) in breadcrumb links
- **URL Encoding**: Properly encodes search terms for safe URL transmission

## Technical Implementation

### Backend Changes (`app.py`)

1. **`view_question()` Function**:
   - Added `search` parameter to filters dictionary
   - Preserves search state when viewing question details

2. **`edit_question()` Function**:
   - Includes search parameter in filter parameters
   - Maintains search state during question editing

3. **`delete_question()` Function**:
   - Preserves search query when redirecting after deletion
   - Ensures users return to their filtered/searched view

### Frontend Changes

1. **`question_detail.html`**:
   - Updated breadcrumb generation to include search parameter
   - Modified Edit button URL to preserve search state
   - Updated Delete form action to maintain search context

2. **`questions.html`**:
   - Enhanced "View Details" links to include search query
   - Ensures search state transfers when navigating to question details

## User Experience Improvements

### Before:
- Search would be lost when viewing question details
- Users had to re-enter search terms after viewing/editing questions
- Filters and search couldn't be used simultaneously effectively

### After:
- **Seamless Navigation**: Search and filter states are preserved across all page transitions
- **Combined Functionality**: Users can search for specific terms AND apply filters simultaneously
- **Persistent State**: Exact search/filter combinations are maintained in browser history
- **Intuitive Breadcrumbs**: Clear navigation path showing current filter/search state

## Usage Examples

1. **Search + Filter Combination**:
   - Search for "grammar" + filter by "Vocabulary" topic + filter by "2023" year
   - Navigate to question details and back - all parameters preserved

2. **Edit with Context**:
   - Search for specific question content
   - Edit the question
   - Return to the exact search results view

3. **Delete with Context**:
   - Apply complex filters and search
   - Delete a question
   - Automatically return to the same filtered/searched view

## Files Modified

1. **`app.py`**: Enhanced filter parameter handling in `view_question()`, `edit_question()`, and `delete_question()` functions
2. **`question_detail.html`**: Updated breadcrumbs, edit links, and delete form to include search parameters
3. **`questions.html`**: Modified question detail links to preserve search state

The integration ensures a smooth, intuitive user experience where search and filtering work together seamlessly without losing context during navigation.
